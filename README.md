## 7th Marathon of Parallel Programming - Python Solutions

To learn more about the Python programming language I decided to solve some of the exercises of the 7th Marathon of Parallel programming. They were
intended to be done in C but I implemented both the sequential and parallel solutions in Python.
So far I have solved:
* Bucketsort
* Friendly numbers
* 3 Sat

You can find the exercises' description [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5RlTI5xhA5UaW53cnNadWlaZE0/view?usp=sharing).
